# MadLibs 
Madlibs is a fun way to learn and practice english. Schools all over the United States use MadLibs to help children improve their language. 
MadLibs helps in making a chinld think creatively and also helps to learn new vocabulary. 

I've created a simple program which consists of 3 MadLibs paragraphs. I will try to update it as I improve my Python skills. 
I am using this program as a benchmark of my programming skills
If you have any issue, drop me a mail. Thank you!
